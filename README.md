> Reactive UI Library for HTML

Cog is a simple, beginner-friendly reactive UI library for building web applications, designed to provide a reactive programming experience using plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript with zero dependencies.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="app">
    <div>Counter: {{ counter }}</div>
    <button onclick="increment()">Increment</button>
</div>
```

```js
// index.js

const counter = variable("counter", 0);
function increment() {
    counter.set(counter.value + 1);
}
```

### Beginner-friendly

With zero dependencies and no extra tooling needed, Cog is a beginner-friendly library that keeps things simple. It uses plain HTML for templates, making it intuitive for those who are new to JavaScript or coming from a background of HTML and CSS.

> When you see HTML in a **Cog** application, it really is just HTML! ü§Ø

Just HTML, but with the added power of reactive expressions. This makes it easy to understand and learn, while still providing the reactivity that makes modern web apps feel smooth and responsive.

## Installation

Just add `<script>` tag to your `index.html`

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mzrk/cog@latest/lib/cog.js"></script>
```

Or you can install it via `npm` package manager:

```bash
npm install @mzrk/cog
```

## Usage

We'll build a simple counter. In this example,¬†`countVariable`¬†is a reactive variable and `count`¬†is the name of the state variable used in the HTML template.

We'll add a new `<script>` tag to our `index.html`. We can then get the `variable` and `render` methods from the global Cog object.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="app">...</div>
<script>
    const { variable, render } = Cog;
    // ...
</script>
```

Then we can write our counter logic and render the app when the DOM is ready:

```js
// Initialize reactive variable 'count'
const countVariable = variable("count", 0);

// Your typical callback function, nothing fancy
function incrementCount(e) {
    // Get count value and update it using count setter
    countVariable.set(countVariable.value + 1);
}

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    // Get the root element
    const rootElement = document.getElementById("app");
    // Render the app
    render(rootElement);
});
```

In the HTML, you can use¬†`{{ count }}` to bind a variable to the text content of an element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="app">
    <div>{{ count }}</div>
    <button onclick="incrementCount()">Increment</button>
</div>
<script>
    ...
</script>
```

When the button is clicked, the¬†`incrementCount`¬†function is called, which updates the¬†`count`¬†variable and triggers a re-render of the UI.

## The Motivation Behind Cog

The primary motivation behind the creation of Cog is to help those who are just getting into web development. We understand that the learning curve can be steep when you're starting out, especially with the multitude of complex libraries and frameworks available today.

Cog aims to flatten this learning curve. It's designed to be a stepping stone to bigger, more complex libraries and frameworks. With Cog, you can focus on learning the core concepts of reactive programming without getting overwhelmed by additional dependencies or complex tooling. All you need is vanilla JavaScript.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Puns Alert!

Cog is not just about coding; it's about reducing your cognitive efforts. Just like a cog in a machine, our library plays a small but crucial role in the larger mechanism of web development. It helps you keep the wheels of your learning journey turning smoothly, without getting stuck on the complexities of state management.

So, gear up and let Cog drive your coding journey with less cognitive friction and more fun!
