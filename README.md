# Cog - Reactive Expression Library

**Cog** is a simple reactive expression library for building web applications. It's a UI library that allows you to create reactive variables and bind them to HTML templates. It's designed to provide a reactive programming experience without the need for complex syntax or extensive libraries.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>Counter: {{ counter }}</div>
<button onclick="increment()">Increment</button>
```

```js
// index.js

const counter = variable("counter", 0);
function increment() {
    counter.set(counter.value + 1);
}
```

### Beginner-friendly

With zero dependencies and no extra tooling needed, **Cog** is a beginner-friendly library that keeps things simple. It uses plain HTML for templates, making it intuitive for those who are new to JavaScript or coming from a background of HTML and CSS.

> When you see HTML in a **Cog** application, it really is just HTML! ðŸ¤¯

HTML - but with the added power of reactive expressions. This makes it easy to understand and learn, while still providing the reactivity that makes modern web apps feel smooth and responsive.

## Installation

You can install **Cog** via npm:

```bash
npm install @mzrk/cog
```

## Basic concepts

### `variable`

`variable`Â is a function that creates a new reactive variable. It is used to create a state variable within theÂ `state`Â object of theÂ **Cog**Â library. It takes a name and an initial value as arguments, and adds an entry to theÂ `state`Â object with the given name and value.

The function returns an object with aÂ `set`Â method and aÂ `value`Â getter. TheÂ `set`Â method allows you to update the value of the state variable from your JavaScript code. It takes a new value as an argument, and updates the state variable with this new value. TheÂ `value`Â getter allows you to retrieve the current value of the state variable from your JavaScript code.

```js
// index.js

import { variable } from "@mzrk/cog";

const { set, value } = variable("meaningOfLife", 41);
```

When a state variable's value is updated using theÂ `set`Â method, the UI is re-rendered, and any expressions referencing that variable are re-evaluated with the new value. This design allows the expressions in your HTML to automatically update whenever the state changes.

### `state`

TheÂ `state`Â object is a key-value store that holds the current state of all reactive variables in the application. Each key in theÂ `state`Â object corresponds to the name of a reactive variable, and the associated value is the current value of that variable.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>{{ meaningOfLife + 1 }}</div>
```

When an expression is evaluated, it's done so in the context of theÂ `state`Â object. This means that any variables referenced in the expression are looked up in theÂ `state`Â object.

```js
// Cog.js under the hood

const state = {
    meaningOfLife: 41,
};
const expression = "meaningOfLife + 1";
evaluateExpression(expression, state); // 42
```

Cog calls theÂ `evaluateExpression`Â function internally when rendering UI with reactive variables. It creates a new function with values from the state in it's scope and executes the expression.

```js
// Example function created by evaluateExpression
const func = () => {
    const meaningOfLife = 41; // variable form the state

    return meaningOfLife + 1; // expression
}();
```

## Usage

In this example,Â `countVariable`Â is a reactive variable. `count`Â is the name of the state variable used in the HTML template.

```js
// index.js

import { variable } from "@mzrk/cog";

// Initialize reactive variable 'count'
const countVariable = variable("count", 0);

// Your typical callback function, nothing fancy
function incrementCount(e) {
    // Get count value and update it using count setter
    countVariable.set(countVariable.value + 1);
}
```

In the HTML, you can useÂ `{{ count }}`Â to bind a variable to the text content of an element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>
    <div>{{ count }}</div>
    <button onclick="incrementCount()">Increment</button>
</div>
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

When the button is clicked, theÂ `incrementCount`Â function is called, which updates theÂ `count`Â variable and triggers a re-render of the UI.

## Contributions

Hey there! If you're interested in the Cog project, I'd love to have you on board. Here's how you can help out:

-   **Bug Reports**: Found a bug? Let me know! Just create an issue in the GitHub repository with the details and steps to reproduce it.

-   **Feature Requests**: Got a cool idea for a new feature or improvement? I'm all ears. Drop an issue describing your idea.
